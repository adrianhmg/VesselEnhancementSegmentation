# VesselEnhancementSegmentation
# Language: Python 3.4
Prototype of vessel enhancement segmentation computed aided coronary artery from my tesis.

This project uploaded on Git doesn't has input images, if you want to use this prototype you
need several packages installed on PIP, or in direct in your compiler:

    * OpenCV 3.3.0
    * NumPy 1.13.0
    * Python Imaging Library (PIL) 4.1.1
    * Matplotlib 2.0.2
    * SciPy 0.19.0
    * Pandas 0.23.3
    * Mahotas 1.4.3

Then put an image on "VesslEnhancementSegmentation/images/inputs" it's preferred to be on ".png" in "grayscale" file then
run the command "python3 VesselEnhancementSegmentation.py", it will give you some the segmented image, with metrics.
You can check it at "VesslEnhancementSegmentation/images/outputs"

Hope this project can help you to stuy Vision Processing Images.
